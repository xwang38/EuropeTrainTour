README

purpose of this program:
Figuring how to take train from one city to another in Europe is just a headache (because sometimes one city doesn't necessarily go to another city. Therefore, you might have to change your train somewhere). My program computes the shortest path for your travel.

Input:
user input of destination and origin (city name has to be the same as the one in eurail.txt in my folder)

Output:
My program will draw the entire graph in green and highlight the path from origin to destination in yellow.

Requirement:
Python 3
python3 site-packages include matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.basemap, pillow, numpy
